## Obligatory "Hello, World!" Example

Here we simply perform the obligatory "Hello, World!", but with some MPI flair.

If you are running linux, you can simply run the `run.sh` file to see this example in action (assuming your environment is correct, see main repository [README.md](https://github.com/lcford2/py_mpi/blob/main/README.md)). Otherwise, you can open `run.sh` to see how I am running the code and run it on your own.
